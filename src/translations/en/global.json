    "p3": "The main one is watercolor on cotton paper. I often complement it with gouache, ink, crayons, pencils, graphite, gold leaf...",
    "h64": "What I enjoy most about watercolor",
    "p4": "Taking the paint, moistening the watercolor, melting the brush in the mixture, seeing how the water settles on the paper, how the watercolor pigment expands in the water... each step of the process is a joy for me. I apply this art to both original works and reproductions that can be used for a print, to stamp a fabric, to decorate beautiful tableware... Sharing my knowledge with people who enjoy and are enriched by their creativity is another facet that also fills me."
